Triggered by a dedicated button (e.g., a \"More\" or three-dot icon), it appears as a popover, offering a focused set of options like edit, delete, copy, or share. The context menu enhances user efficiency by surfacing relevant actions directly tied to the selected item, reducing clutter and improving accessibility.",
