In the default mode, a `refresh()` method needs to be called for the component to update and reflect the current state of the form. In the `reactive` mode, it will update on the fly as soon as the status of a control in the form changes. The `reactive` mode requires less setup to use, but the `default` mode allows for more control over the behavior."
