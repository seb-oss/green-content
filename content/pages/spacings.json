Too little space creates clutter, while too much can weaken relationships between components.\n\nThoughtful spacing enhances readability and usability, ensuring every element has room to breathe.\n\nWhite space isn’t empty space - it’s an active part of the design. It improves focus, increases legibility, and makes interfaces feel more open and approachable.\n\nGreen uses space tokens based on a 4 px grid system. This scale applies to margin, padding, gap, radius, and all spacing values. When designing layouts, spacing values range from 1 px to 120 px, providing flexibility.",
