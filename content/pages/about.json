Instead of spending time on building and re-building the same components in multiple teams, teams can spend that time on addressing specific user needs to improve user experience.\n\nThe design system is called Green as an homage to SEB being viewed as the green bank with green as a primary colour for the brand and the bank. The bank also plays a great role in the transition to anet zero societyand has a focus onsustainabilityand helping it's clients to become more sustainable. The design system initative was also seen as aGreenfieldproject."
