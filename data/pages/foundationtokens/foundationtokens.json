They replace hardcoded values with self-explanatory names so designers and engineers reference the same source of truth. A token has two parts:\n\n1.  A code like name, such as: `gds.sys.color.l3.background.primary`\n    \n2.  An associated value, such as: `#1b1b1b`\n    \n\nA token’s value can be a color, a typeface, a measurement, or even a reference to another token. If a designer and an engineer both reference the token for “secondary container color,” they will get the same color everywhere — even if the underlying hex value changes later."
