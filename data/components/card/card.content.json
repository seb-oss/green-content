White  \nPurpose: Clean, high-contrast container that draws more attention.  \nUse when:  \nThe content is colorful, like when visualising charts and needs to stand out within a grey background.  \nYou want a crisp, lightweight feel.   \n3\\. Senior green  \nPurpose: Reinforces SEB's brand identity and highlights key content.  \nUse when:  \nYou want to add emphasis while aligning with SEB’s brand colors.   \n4\\.
