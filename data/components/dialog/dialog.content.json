  "preamble": "Dialogs are used to provide the user with a focused interface for specific tasks or information, appearing as a temporary window that requires user interaction before returning to the main application.\n\nDialogs are modal, meaning they block interaction with the rest of the application or interface until the user addresses the dialog (e.g., by clicking a button, entering input, or closing it). This ensures the user focuses on the dialog's content before returning to the main workflow, and also ensures that keyboard and screen reader focus is kept within the dialog.",

Clearly state the purpose and options.\n    \n*   Use button ranks to make the primary action obvious. For example, use the primary button for “Save” and secondary for “Cancel”\n    \n*   Ensure the dialog relates to the user’s current task. Include relevant details, like the name of the item being deleted."

Overusing dialogs interrupts workflow and causes \"dialog fatigue.\"\n    \n*   Don’t use dialogs for extensive forms or complex tasks that require significant screen space or navigation. Use a full page or panel instead.\n    \n*   Avoid dialogs for repetitive tasks, as they slow users down. Allow users to opt out or streamline the process with settings (e.g., \"Don’t ask again\")."
